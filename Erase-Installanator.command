# Erase-Installanator v1.0
#
# This will allow you to use eraseinstall from a USB stick with a Big Sur installer
# just by double-clicking, typing in a password, and walking away like a bossss
#
# Works on any Big Sur machine - including M1s!
#
# It will capture the account password immediately and not make you wait the 3-5 mins
# while it verifies the installer's integrity - because we all know you're going to start
# the script, walk away, come back an hour later and facepalm at the --passprompt ;)
#
# Drop this into a .command file & throw it the root of a USB stick with a Big Sur installer.
# Double-cick .command file to run, type in the pass (validated immediately), and go do
# something better with your time!
