# Erase-Installanator v1.2

 This will allow you to use eraseinstall from a USB stick with a Monterey installer
 just by double-clicking, typing in a password, and walking away like a bossss

 Works on any Monterey machine - including M1s!

 It will capture the account password immediately and not make you wait the 3-5 mins
 while it verifies the installer's integrity - because we all know you're going to start
 the script, walk away, come back an hour later and facepalm at the --passprompt ;)

 Drop this into a .command file & throw it the root of a USB stick with a Monterey installer.
 Double-cick .command file to run, type in the pass (validated immediately), and go do
 something better with your time!
