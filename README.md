# Erase-Installanator
Run Big Sur eraseinstall from a USB stick with one-click &amp; a single password entry.

This will allow you to use eraseinstall from a USB stick with a Big Sur installer just by double-clicking, typing in a password, and walking away like a bossss

Works on any Big Sur machine - including M1s!

It will capture the account password immediately and not make you wait the 3-5 mins while it verifies the installer's integrity - because we all know you're going to start the script, walk away, come back an hour later and facepalm at the --passprompt ;)

Drop this into a .command file & throw it the root of a USB stick with a Big Sur installer. Double-cick .command file to run, type in the pass (validated immediately), and go do something better with your time!
